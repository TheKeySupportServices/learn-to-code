# Session 2 - Data Structures

This'll learn you to feed your turtle after dark...

Continuing to use Python's Turtle library, we explore the basic `list` and `dict` data
structures by solving some very urgent problems.


## Goals

1) Build upon previous session's foundation knowledge and introduce data structures to
   solve a more complex problem.

2) See how problems can be made easier by selecting the right data structure.

3) Introduction to conditionals.


## The exercises:

* [2.1 Exercise: Baby turtles!](2.1-exercise.md)
* [2.2 Exercise: Poop!](2.2-exercise.md)
* [2.3 Exercise: Summon a pool](2.3-exercise.md)
* [2.4 Exercise: Chow time](2.4-exercise.md)
* [2.5 Exercise: Inspire joy](2.5-exercise.md)


## Summary

By completing these exercises you will have hit some more fundamentals of coding:

* `list` and `dict` data structures
* Introduction to `if`
* Relating problems to structure of data
