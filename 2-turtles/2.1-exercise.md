# 2.1 Exercise: Baby turtles

## The task

Congratulations! You fed your turtle after midnight and it's had babies!

Create a "`list`" containing 10 baby turtles, and have them move in random directions
for a while.


## What you'll achieve

1) Understanding of the `list` data structure

2) Create some chaos!


## Get started:

1) Go here: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle

2) Replace all the example code with just this:

    ```python
    import turtle
    ```


## What you need to know

Data structures are a core concept in coding. A lot of problems are made much simpler by
structuring data in a way which allows you to approach the problem in the most
straightforward way.

Some simple data structures are built into Python, such as the `list`... which is often
called an "array" in other programming languages.

---

Lists allow us to have one variable which contain many other values. They're very
useful!

We can create a `list` with square brackets:

```python
my_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
    "Bobble",
    "Dobble"
]
```

The above list has 4 values in it. We can refer to a specific item in the list by its
position in the list, normally called the "index".

**The 1st item in an array has an index of 0!**

```python
my_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
    "Bobble",
    "Dobble"
]

# This will put "Bobble" into a new variable (remember the index starts at 0!):
value_from_list = my_list[2]
```

---

It's fine to change a value in a list:

```python
my_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
    "Bobble",
    "Dobble"
]

my_list[2] = "Achoo!"
```

---

We can add items onto a list by using `append`:

```python
my_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
    "Bobble",
    "Dobble"
]

my_list.append("Dibble")

# Now "Dibble" has been added to the list, we can retrieve it by its index:
value_from_list = my_list[4]
```

---

As we can append to lists, creating an initially empty list is fine!

```python
my_list = []

my_list.append("Wibble")
```

---

Lists can contain pretty much anything! Including other lists, which is useful
if we're dealing with nested data, matrixes or other complicated shapes of data.

```python
my_list = [
    "Wibble"
    24,
    [
        "Bilbo Baggins",
        "Harry Potter",
    ]
]

a_value_from_deep = my_list[2][1]  # "Harry Potter" - remember the index starts at 0
```

---

We can even put your turtle into a list:

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Create a list with 3 different turtles in it:
turtles = [
    turtle.Turtle(),
    turtle.Turtle(),
    turtle.Turtle(),
]

# Move just the 1st turtle
turtles[0].forward(100)
```

---

A great feature of lists is being able to "loop over" them easily:

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Create a list with 3 different turtles in it:
turtles = [
    turtle.Turtle(),
    turtle.Turtle(),
    turtle.Turtle(),
]

# Move all the turtles
for t in turtles:
    t.forward(100)
```

---

Creating a random number is easy. Put this at the top of your code:

```python
from random import randint
```

And then you can create a random integer (a whole number) like this:

```python
# Will pick a random integer (a whole number) between 0 and 100
some_random_number = randint(0, 100)
```
