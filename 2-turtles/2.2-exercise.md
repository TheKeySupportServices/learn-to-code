# 2.2 Exercise: Pooping turtles

## The task

As the baby turtles are moving around, they're eating whatever is in their path...
grass, carpet, marbles... you name it and they're eating it!

And the trouble is, what goes in must come out.

The turtles take a bite of food for each unit of distance travelled. So `forward(50)`
would mean they have taken 50 mouthfuls of food.

Use another `list` to keep track of the number of mouthfuls each turtle eats. Once their
distance goes over 100, then the turtle poops and you should reset their count of
mouthfuls back to 0.


## What you'll achieve

1) Exposure to `if` statements

2) Using `list`s to solve simple problems

3) Add 2 numbers

4) Make a mess


## Get started:

1) Start from the code you wrote for [Exercise 2.1](2.1-exercise.md).


## What you need to know

When "looping through" lists, we can use `enumerate` to give us the current index:

```python
a_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
]

for index, item in enumerate(a_list):
    print(index, item)
```

---

When using `enumerate`, you sometimes want to use the current index to retrieve data from
another `list`:

```python
a_list = [
    "Wibble",
    "Wobble",
]

another_list = [
    123,
    456,
]

for index, item in enumerate(a_list):
    print(another_list[index])
```

---

Adding numbers together is pretty simple:

```python
total_poops = 123 + 456
```

If a variable holds a number, then you can use the variable in the addition:

```python
paul_poops = 123
total_poops = paul_poops + 456
```

Or 2 variables:

```python
steve_poops = 456
paul_poops = 123
total_poops = steve_poops + paul_poops
```

---

You can add a variable to itself. Which is very useful for counters!

```python
mouthfuls = mouthfuls + new_mouthfuls
```

---

To check if a number is over a certain value:

```python
if mouthfuls > 100:
    t.circle(3)
```
