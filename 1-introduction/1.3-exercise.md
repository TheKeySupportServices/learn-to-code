# 1.3 Exercise: Draw 3 rectangles

## The task

Your turtle likes the rectangle house! Now your turtle is settled, let's give them something to do by adding a swimming pool and a snooker table.

Luckily these 2 new things are rectangular in shape!

Define a function which draws a rectangle with any height and width you give it.

And then use it draw 3 differently sized rectangles at different points on the canvas.

## What you'll achieve

1) Learn how to define functions

2) Understand how to pass arguments into functions


## Get started:

1) Go here: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle

2) Replace all the example code with just this:

    ```python
    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    ```


## What you need to know

"**Functions**" allow us to define a chunk of code, and then run it whenever we want.


We can define a function a like this:

```python
def do_something():
    t.forward(30)
    t.right(15)
    t.forward(40)
```

And then run it like this:

```python
do_something()
```

Or a more complete example:

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()

def do_something():
    t.forward(30)
    t.right(15)
    t.forward(40)

t.forward(80)

do_something()

t.left(15)

do_something()  # Calling a function multiple times is allowed
```

---

We can define our functions to require "arguments", which it can then use:

```python
def draw_triangle(side_length):
    t.forward(side_length)
    t.right(120)
    t.forward(side_length)
    t.right(120)
    t.forward(side_length)

draw_triangle(100)
```

Notice how the code inside the function is indented? How you indent lines is **very**
important in Python. It uses the indentation to understand what's part of the function
and what's not part of it.

```python
t.forward(200)

def draw_spiral():
    t.forward(10)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(10)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(15)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(20)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(25)

draw_spiral()
```

It's very important to keep your indents consistent. If the above function was written
like this, we would get an error! :


```python
t.forward(200)

def draw_spiral():
    t.forward(10)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(10)
    t.right(90)
     t.forward(15)  # Line not indented correctly, so will cause an error!
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(20)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(25)

draw_spiral()
```

We can move the turtle without it drawing a line by using `penup` and `pendown`:

```python
t.forward(20)
t.penup()
t.forward(100)
t.pendown()
t.forward(20)
```
