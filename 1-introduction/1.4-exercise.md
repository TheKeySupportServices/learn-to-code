# 1.4 Exercise: Let's feed the turtle

## The task

Your turtle didn't use the snooker table much, but has had a nice swim and worked up an
appetite. Time to make them some food! Turtles like to eat flowers, and rather
conveniently, particularly ones with petals that are rectangles.

Create a new function which will loop over your rectangle function from [Exercise
1.3](1.3-exercise.md) lots of times, drawing each one at a slightly different angle.
Also make sure to make it an appetising colour for the turtle!

## What you'll achieve

1) Know how to loop over code a set number of times

2) You'll call a function from another function

3) You'll take us back to 1983 with your incredible spiragraph abilities!


## Get started:

1) Start with your solution from [Exercise 1.3](1.3-exercise.md)


## What you need to know

"**`for` loops**" allow you to repeat code a set number of times.

For example, the following `for` loop will repeat (iterate) the block of code within it
20 times:

```python
for i in range(20):
    t.right(10)
    t.forward(20)
```

---

The same indentation rules apply for `for` loops as they do for functions. So make sure
you're consistent!

---

A function can call another function really easily!

```python
def right_angle(length):
    t.forward(length)
    t.right(90)
    t.forward(length)

def square(length):
    right_angle(length)  # Calling another function from within this function!
    t.right(90)
    right_angle(length)  # And again!

square(100)
```

---

Functions can contain `for` loops:

```python
def function_with_a_loop():
    for i in range(20):
        t.right(10)
        t.forward(20)
```

---

Setting the colour of the lines is done by setting the `pencolor`:

```python
t.pencolor("red")  # You can use a named colour

t.pencolor("#ff2245")  # Or a hex code
```

**Make sure** you put the colour in quotation marks!

The named colours are listed here: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp

Or you can use a colour picker: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
