# 1.5 Exercise: Draw some artwork for the turtle to hang in their new home

## The task

Your turtle has picked a new home and is starting to settle. However their walls are
very bare! Let's use the skills you've learnt to draw your turtle some artwork to
inspire and spark their joy.

Your turtle has a wide range of interests including:

* Science fiction
* Summer meadows with flowers
* Brighly coloured geometry
* Your name

Maybe try drawing something around these topics, or feel free to choose something else
your turtle might enjoy.


## What you'll achieve

1) How much you can do with just a little bit of coding

2) Some more tricks with the turtle


## Get started:

1) Start with your solution from [Exercise 1.4](1.4-exercise.md)


## What you need to know

There's a lot of useful features of the turtle we've not explored yet. These docs are
really useful: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/docs/turtle

They show how you set a fill colour, move the turtle to specific coordinates, change the
width of the pen, and more!

Feel free to explore and have fun!
