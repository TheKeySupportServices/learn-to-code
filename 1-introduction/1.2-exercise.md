# 1.2 Exercise: Draw a rectangle with easy to set height and width

## The task

Your project manager has been touch. She'd like a rectangle drawn... but she isn't too
sure what size it needs to be yet. She'll let us know about 2 seconds before we actually
need to draw it!

What a pain! So, write some code which allows us to set `height` and `width` variables,
and then use them to draw a rectangle.


## What you'll achieve

1) An understanding of what variables are...

2) And how they can make your life easier.


## Get started:

1) Go here: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle

2) Replace all the example code with just this:

    ```python
    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    ```


## What you need to know

"**Variables**" allow us to store information for use later on. They are a core concept
to understand. You can't do much without using variables at some point.

Variables are defined like this:

```python
angle = 25
distance = 150
```

And then can be used in place of values:

```python
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
```

---

They can be used multiple times, so the following is totally valid code:

```python
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
t.forward(distance)
```

---

You can name your variables whatever you'd like, with some rules:

```python
wibble = 123

# In Python they should all be lowercase and use a _ character to separate words:
wibble_wobble = 890
```

Other programming languages have different recommendations and rules for naming
variables!
