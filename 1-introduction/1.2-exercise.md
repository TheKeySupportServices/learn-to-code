# 1.2 Exercise: Turtles only live in rectangle houses!

## The task

So anyway, it turns out that squares are deeply offensive to turtles. Oops.

You've promised to make a perfect rectangle house for your turtle instead of a square
one. But there's a slight problem, you don't know how big to make it! We also know the
turtle is in a very bad mood, so is likely to change their mind at a moment's notice.

So let's make it very easy to change the dimensions of the rectangle by using variables.

Define a `height` and a `width` variable, and use them when drawing a rectangle.

## What you'll achieve

1) An understanding of what variables are...

2) And how they can make your life easier.


## Get started:

1) Go here: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle

2) Replace all the example code with just this:

    ```python
    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    ```


## What you need to know

"**Variables**" allow us to store information for use later on. They are a core concept
to understand. You can't do much without using variables at some point.

Variables are defined like this:

```python
angle = 25
distance = 150
```

And then can be used in place of values:

```python
t.forward(distance)
t.angle(angle)
```

---

They can be used multiple times, so the following is totally valid code:

```python
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
t.right(angle)
t.forward(distance)
```

---

You can name your variables whatever you'd like, with some rules:

```python
wibble = 123

# In Python they should all be lowercase and use a _ character to separate words:
wibble_wobble = 890
```

Other programming languages have different recommendations and rules for naming
variables!
