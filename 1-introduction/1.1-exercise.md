# 1.1 Exercise: Build a basic house for the turtle

## The task

Congratulations! You found a turtle under the sofa!

But, they need a place to live. You're a bit pushed for time, so you figure you'll make
them a quick house and see how they like it.

Program your turtle to draw a perfect square for your turtle to live in!

## What you'll achieve

1) Learn that programming code is executed line-by-line

2) See what Python code looks like

3) Make a stunning work of art!


## Get started:

1) Go here: http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle

2) Replace all the example code with just this:

    ```python
    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    ```


## What you need to know

There's likely some example code shown when you access
http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle. Feel free to delete the example code, but make sure
these lines **are at the top**:

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
```

---

The lines of code are executed from top to bottom. But, anything after a `#` is a
"**comment**" and is ignored in the program.

Comments are messages to humans, and are typically used as notes to explain how
something works to a fellow developer.

They are extremely useful when learning to code, as you can leave yourself notes about
how something works!

You'll see (and hopefully use) comments a lot.

```python
# This is a comment. It'll be ignored by the computer and I can put any giberish in
# here that I want! Comments are very useful to humans!

# The following line won't be executed as it's "commented out"...
# t.forward(100)

# But this following line will be executed as it's not "commented out"...
t.forward(100)

# And this next line will be executed, even though it's got a human friendly comment
# after it!
t.forward(100) # Makes the turtle move forward and draw a line
```

---

You can make the turtle move forward & backwards and left & right using these commands:

```python
t.forward(100)
t.back(100)

t.left(45)
t.right(165)  # You can use any angle you want!
```
