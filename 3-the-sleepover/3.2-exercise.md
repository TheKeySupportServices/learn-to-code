# 3.2 Exercise: Party conversations

## The task

The second guest to come up to you is Sammy the Seaslug, who has a very simple way to
communicate with you: he simply turns slightly. Sometimes he turns to the left and
sometimes to the right.

After every 8 turns he pauses for a moment.

You realise that if you consider every time Sammy turns left to be "1", everytime
Sammy turns right to be "0" and each of his pauses to be some sort of separator, you end
up with the following pattern:

```
01001001 00100000 01001100 01001111 01010110 01000101 00100000 01010000 01001001 01001110 01000011 01001000 01011001
```

This looks like binary! What does it say?


## What you'll achieve

1) Understanding of binary

2) The ability to communicate with Sea Slugs


## Get started:

1) You need pen, paper and a calculator

2) https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html


## What you need to know

Binary follows _exactly_ the same rules as decimal. But we only have 2 numbers
available: 0 or 1.

So the number 4,262 would be represented like this in binary:

| 4096 | 2048 | 1024 | 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| 1    | 0    | 0    | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

`4,262` in decimal = `1000010100110` in binary.
