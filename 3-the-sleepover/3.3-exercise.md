# 3.3 Exercise: Party conversations

## The task

You notice that Woody the Woodlouse hasn't said anything to you yet, and is instead sat
in the corner rubbing his stomach. He must be hungry!

You know that woodlice eat dead leaves and fungi, and you have some of each in in the
fridge. But how many to give to Woody?

When you ask, Woody dances a very twisted version of YMCA, throwing his **16 legs** into
the shape of various numbers and letters:

```
1F
94FA3
```

How many dead leaves and how many fungal spores is Woody asking for?


## What you'll achieve

1) An introduction to the hexadecimal number system


## Get started:

1) You need pen, paper and a calculator


## What you need to know

Hexadecimal, or Base 16 follows exactly the same rules as decimal and binary, but this
time we have 16 digits available instead of just 10 or 2.

As we're only allowed to put 1 character in each column in the number table, we
represent the digits `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14` & `15` as `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` &
`F`.

So with hexadecimal, we have the values 0 to F available to us!

---

So the number 4,262 would be represented like this in hexadecimal:

| 4,096 | 256 | 16 | 1 |
| ----- | --- | -- | - |
| 1     | 0   | A  | 6 |

So the number `4,262` in decimal, is represented as `10A6` in hexadecimal!
