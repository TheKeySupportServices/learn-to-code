# 3.4 Exercise: Party conversations

## The task

The last guest to come up to you is Cuthbert the Cuttlefish. Cuthbert's way of
communicating is to change colour infront of you!

You quickly take a photo of Cuthbert each time he changes colour. These are the colours
he changes to:

What is Cuthbert trying to say to you?


## What you'll achieve

1) Understanding of colour codes


## Get started:

1) You need pen and paper

2) https://www.ascii-code.com/


## What you need to know

Colours in code are often expressed in "hex codes", which look something like `#FE12E2`.

You can ignore the `#` character, that's just there to tell computers that it's a hex
colour code.

Hex colour codes are not actually 1 big hex number, but actually 3 numbers put together.

The code above is actually these 3 hexadecimal numbers:

* `FE`
* `12` (that's `12` in hex, not decimal!)
* `E2`

Each number provides a value for the Red, Green or Blue part of the colour.

So `#FE12E2` translates to the following in decimal:

* Red part: `FE` = `254`
* Green part: `12` = `18`
* Blue part: `E2` = `226`

Which produces this nice shade of purple:

We can make (almost) any colour using a combination of just Red, Green or Blue light.

Not all sea creatures speak English, so might be good to use the extended ASCII chart:
