# 4.2 Exercise:

## The task

We're off to a great start, your animated gif has set the scene nicely, but now let's
start making the site a bit more useful!

Let's add a picture of the school and also a map to the school.


## What you'll achieve

1) Use of the `img` element

2) See how easy it is to embed Google Maps


## Get started:

1) You need a text editor. Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac are fine.

2) Your HTML from the previous exercise.

3) The image site of your choosing

4) https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/embedding-map


## What you need to know

Images are added to a site using the `img` element:

```html
<img src="Springfield_Elementary_School.png" />
```

There's a few things going on with that `img` element...

---

Firstly, notice there's no start and closing tag? It's just 1 tag?

`img` is a "self closing" tag, which means we **don't write it like this**:

```html
<img src="Springfield_Elementary_School.png"></img>
```

Not having separate start and closing tags makes sense when you think about it, as
there's not any element which would be a sensible child for an `img` tag.

---

The `src=` part is an **attribute**, which allows us to tell the `img` element where to
find the image it should be using:

```html
<img src="Springfield_Elementary_School.png" />
```

Different elements have different attributes available. The [Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) is a great reference
for the details!

---

When you download your school image, make sure to put it in the same folder as your HTML
file.

---

To embed a Google Map onto your site:

```html
<iframe
  width="600"
  height="450"
  style="border:0"
  loading="lazy"
  allowfullscreen
  src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=XXXXXXX&q=Space+Needle,Seattle+WA">
</iframe>
```

Notice this is using attributes as well?

**Note:** You will need to put a working Google Project API Key into the URL in the
`src` attribute.

---

The Google Map embed can be customised a lot! The documentation is pretty decent:
