# 3.2 Exercise: Party conversations

## The task

The second guest to come up to you is Sammy the Seaslug, who has a very simple way to
communicate with you: he simply turns slightly. Sometimes he turns to the left and
sometimes to the right.

After every 8 turns he pauses for a moment.

You realise that if you consider every time Sammy turns left to be "1", everytime
Sammy turns right to be "0" and each of his pauses to be some sort of separator, you end
up with the following pattern:

```
01001001
00100000
01001100
01001111
01010110
01000101
00100000
01010000
01001001
01001110
01000011
01001000
01011001
```

This looks like binary! What does it say?
