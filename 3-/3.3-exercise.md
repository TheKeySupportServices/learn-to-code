# 3.3 Exercise: Party conversations

## The task

You notice that Woody the Woodlouse hasn't said anything to you yet, and is instead sat
in the corner rubbing his stomach. He must be hungry!

You know that woodlice eat fungi, and you have some fungal spores in the fridge. But how
many to give to Woody?

When you ask, Woody dances a very twisted version of YMCA, throwing his **16 legs** into
the shape of various numbers and letters:

```
94FA3
```

How many fungal spores is Woody asking for?
